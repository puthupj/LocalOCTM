Use function locOctm(filename,row_div,col_div,u,d).
Use imshow() to display image.
row_div is the number of row divisions
col_div is the number of column divisions
u,d are parameters for OCTM (We find that u = 2 and d = 15 work well)
Use locOctm(filename,1,1,u,d) for global OCTM
use row_div >= 2 and col_div >= 2 for localized OCTM to be applied.
